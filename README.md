Implementing some common Algorithms in JavaScript

## Reverse Words Algorithm

Basically the idea is to reverse a string of single or multiple words

For example if we enter _"I don't like JavaScript"_ then it'll return _"i t'nod ekil tpircsavaj"_

## Fizz Buzz

Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division. Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number **divisible by three with the word "fizz",** and any number **divisible by five with the word "buzz"**.

## is Palindrome

A string is said to be palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. i,e, Eye

## Binary Search

Binary search works on sorted arrays. Binary search begins by comparing an element in the middle of the array with the target value. If the target value matches the element, its position in the array is returned. If the target value is less than the element, the search continues in the lower half of the array. If the target value is greater than the element, the search continues in the upper half of the array. By doing this, the algorithm eliminates the half in which the target value cannot lie in each iteration

- Search for a given value(key) inside of a list(numArray)
- Runs in O (log n) run time - very performant
- Can be written as a recursive function
